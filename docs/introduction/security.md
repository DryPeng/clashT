## About

ClashT is a network management tool, so security is important to ClashT.

We will put the Security of ClashT first, so at some update, some functions may be canceled to ensure User safety.


## Danger Levels

Here, we introduce a concept to distinguish danger levels.

- Level 1: Superlative, there are dangerous in all situations. (90%+)
- Level 2: Need to be vigilant, only in some cases there is **no** danger. (70%+)
- Level 3: Be careful, there are some cases is danger. (45% ~ 70%)
- Level 4: Can be ignored, there is no danger under most situations. (25% ~ 45%)
- Level 5: Safe, there may be risks we haven’t discovered yet. (0%+)

::: To prevent disagreements
"danger" refers (including but not limited) to ClashT crashing, User being attacked, and encryption fail. :::

<sub><i>The percentages are our expected numbers and do not imply that we calculated them accurately.</i></sub>
