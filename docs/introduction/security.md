# Security

ClashT is a network management tool, so security is important to ClashT.

We will put the Security of ClashT first, so at some update, some functions may be canceled to ensure User safety.


## Danger Levels

Here, we introduce a concept to distinguish danger levels.

- Level 1: **Superlative**, there are dangerous in all situations. (90%+)
- Level 2: **Need to be vigilant**, only in some cases there is **no** danger. (70%+)
- Level 3: **Be careful**, there are some cases is danger. (45% ~ 70%)
- Level 4: **Can be ignored**, there is no danger under most situations. (25% ~ 45%)
- Level 5: **Safe**, there may be risks we haven’t discovered yet. (0%+)

::: tip To Prevent Disagreements
"danger" refers (including but not limited) to ClashT crashing, User being attacked, and encryption fail.

### Experimental Features

Not only for updates, we will also introduce experimental features in other cores (ClashT being a normal core). These features may pose certain risks; therefore, their danger levels will be clearly stated in the documentation.
