# Maintenance Time

For [security reasons](https://clasht.drypeng.io/introduction/security.html), we provide ***maintenance time*** for each version, which means that the version can be supported.

## Version List

Please check the following list to confirm whether the version you are currently using is still supported.

- v1.20.0 (NEW)
- v1.19.0
- v1.18.1
- v1.18.0

::: tip Tip
SE means it support ended

W means it will support ended when next version released

NEW means it will have security updates or fixes
:::

### What does end of support mean?

Although your software will still run, but we will no longer provide the following: 

- Technical support of any issue
- Security updates or fixes


### What about version that is not "NEW"?

Any version that is not "NEW" does not have ***Security updates or fixes*** base on the that version. In other words, the issues you submit will be placed on the "NEW" version when they are fixed.
