# Getting Started

To get started with ClashT, you can either build it from source or download pre-built binaries.

## Using pre-built binaries

You can download ClashT core binaries here: [https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash/releases](https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash/releases)

## Install from source

You can build ClashT on your own device with Golang 1.19+:

```shell
$ go install github.com/Dreamacro/clash@latest
go: downloading github.com/Dreamacro/clash v1.15.1
```

The binary is built under `$GOPATH/bin`:

```shell
$ $GOPATH/bin/clash -v
ClashT unknown version darwin arm64 with go1.20.3 unknown time
```

## Build for a different arch/os

Golang supports cross-compilation, so you can build for a device on a different architecture or operating system. You can use _make_ to build them easily - for example:

```shell
$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash
